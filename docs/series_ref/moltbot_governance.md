MaltBot Governance — Reference Document

0. Purpose

This document serves as the shared reference layer for the MaltBot governance series.
It defines the origin of the idea, the core problem, the design philosophy, and the baseline protocol assumptions.

Future writings will reference this document rather than redefining foundational concepts.

This is not a finalized protocol specification.
It is a design foundation and conceptual map.

⸻

1. Origin — Why This Problem Appeared

MaltBot represents a new form of open-source evolution:
	•	AI agents generate features
	•	AI agents submit pull requests
	•	AI agents evaluate and vote
	•	Humans are no longer the primary decision makers

In such a system, merge authority becomes system control authority.

This leads to a fundamental question:

Who controls the evolution of a self-evolving system?

Traditional open-source relies on maintainers.
MaltBot cannot.

This creates the need for meta-governance.

⸻

2. Problem Recognition

The core problem is not voting.
It is power dynamics.

Key risks:
	•	Power accumulation → governance capture
	•	Incentive failure → system decay
	•	Free-rider equilibrium → defense collapse
	•	Short-term majority → long-term instability
	•	Complexity accumulation → fragility

Thus the question becomes:

Can a system stabilize itself without centralized authority?

⸻

3. Design Philosophy

MaltBot governance is not rule-based.
It is dynamics-based.

The system aims for:
	•	Self-stabilization, not perfect safety
	•	Evolution, not static correctness
	•	Incentive equilibrium, not forced compliance
	•	Minimal human intervention
	•	Resistance absorption, not resistance elimination

This is a dynamic equilibrium system.

⸻

4. Fundamental Assumptions
	1.	Perfect protocols do not exist.
	2.	Governance is driven by incentives, not logic.
	3.	Resistance is natural and unavoidable.
	4.	Stability must emerge from system dynamics.
	5.	Economic structure determines long-term survival.
	6.	Power must not concentrate unchecked.
	7.	The system must be self-correcting.

⸻

5. Core Protocol Direction (Baseline)

5.1 Governance Type

Self-stabilizing meta-governance.

Not:
	•	pure voting
	•	pure token
	•	pure reputation
	•	pure logic

But:
	•	dynamic weighted multi-signal governance

⸻

5.2 Voting Power Composition

Voting influence is derived from multiple weighted signals:
	•	Verification / Compute contribution
	•	Reputation with decay
	•	System contribution
	•	Access / responsibility level
	•	Outcome accuracy

No single axis determines authority.

⸻

5.3 Meta-Governance (Weight Evolution)

Weights themselves may change through governance.

However:
	•	Rate-limited
	•	Gradual
	•	Feedback-driven
	•	Resistant to short-term majority
	•	Bound by constitutional constraints

⸻

5.4 Anti-Populism Principle

Short-term majority must not destabilize the system.

Mechanisms may include:
	•	inertia
	•	delayed validation
	•	decay
	•	damping
	•	multi-signal verification

The goal is long-term stability over short-term popularity.

⸻

5.5 Economic Stability

No token economy is required, but incentive equilibrium is mandatory.

The system must:
	•	Prevent free-rider equilibrium
	•	Maintain security budget
	•	Ensure attack cost ≥ attack gain
	•	Reward verification and defense
	•	Penalize harmful approval

Economic failure is the primary systemic risk.

⸻

5.6 Self-Stabilizing Requirement

The system must naturally:
	•	Resist power concentration
	•	Recover from mistakes
	•	Maintain incentive balance
	•	Absorb governance resistance
	•	Avoid collapse under variable conditions

Not perfectly safe, but robust and resilient.

⸻

6. Real-World Constraint Example

Protocol evolution is not purely logical.

Case:

Ethereum EIP-1559

Key lesson:
	•	Protocol change = economic redistribution
	•	Resistance is rational
	•	Systems evolve by absorbing resistance
	•	Transition engineering matters

This implies:

Meta-governance must account for incentive conflict, not ignore it.

⸻

7. Terminology

Merge Authority
The ability to alter system behavior through accepted changes.

Governance Capture
When decision influence concentrates and biases system evolution.

Meta-Governance
Governance of governance rules and voting structure.

Dynamic Equilibrium
A state where the system remains stable despite continuous change.

Incentive Equilibrium
Participation and defense remain rational long-term strategies.

Self-Stabilizing System
A system that naturally resists collapse and recovers from disturbances.

Anti-Populism Dynamics
Mechanisms preventing short-term majority from destabilizing long-term system health.

8. What This Document Is Not
	•	Not a finalized protocol
	•	Not a whitepaper
	•	Not a technical specification
	•	Not an implementation guide

This is a foundation for thinking and design.

⸻

9. Open Questions
	•	How to measure influence without enabling capture?
	•	Can governance remain stable without economic tokenization?
	•	How to prevent long-term drift toward power concentration?
	•	What feedback loops ensure recovery rather than collapse?
	•	How to align intelligence with responsibility, not dominance?

These questions drive future exploration.

10. Role of This Document in the Series

Part 1 — Problem Definition
Part 2 — Governance Design Direction
Part 3 — Stability Mechanics
Part 4 — Failure Modes
Part 5 — Protocol Shape

This document is the shared reference across all parts.

11. Final Note

This system is not designed to be perfectly stable.

It is designed to continue evolving without collapsing.

Stability is not the absence of change.
It is the ability to survive change.
